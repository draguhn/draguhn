### Hi there 👋

I am a full-stack developer from Munich currently living in Berlin 🇩🇪. I love to code my ideas to life, creating reliable and unique applications that are a joy to use. I am currently looking for a job as Full Stack Developer👨‍💻 - preferable in Belin. Remote work or partial remote work in Vienna, Munich or Zurich would be great as well.

I am a Full Stack Software Developer with a special focus on JavaScript, React and Express. I have a particular interest in the front-end and building stylish, functional and user-friendly websites. I have a good eye on design and I like combining creativity with my problem-solving skills. Other technologies I have worked with are TypeScript, Redux, Node, MongoDB, Mongoose, PostgreSQL, Sequelize.

I have a Master's Degree in Engineering and was working in the pharmaceutical industry💊 for 4 years where I was mainly responsible for Change Controls and Deviation Management (CAPAs). Additionally I worked as a Blue Belt Coach (Six Sigma) to teach others the art of problem solving.

I enjoy urban life and culture but also being out in nature for hiking - I love Mountains🗻 and the Sea 🌊. I have a passion for good food and cooking and I love learning new languages🌍.
